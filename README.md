A couple homework assignments from CS 435

ColorDatabase is our first homework involving databases 
-we had to design an app that had to create an amount of colors (user provided) 
-then fill our database with them (the RG and B values) 
-then read them into our app and display with a recycler view and allow the user to chose how the recycler view is
organized and also select favorites (updating our database) which is another sorting option.

Fragment_games is a homework where we had to make an app that allowed the user to 
-play a number guessing game or tic tac toe on the top or bottom of the screen or both
(crowded feeling in the app but was focused on practicing fragmentation)
